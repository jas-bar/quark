Quark Game Library                         {#mainpage}
============

# What is Quark?
Quark is not an engine. Quark is a library which uses SDL2 as engine.
It only provides set of commonly used things and utilities which
are related to game development. 
Some of these are: game states, FPS limiter, input interface, resource manager.

Those utilities are kept in an object-oriented model which makes your code
cleaner and easier to extend.
